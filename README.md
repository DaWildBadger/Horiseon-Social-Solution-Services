## <h2 style="text-align:center" id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

This is a single page website.

I built this website as a way to practice my html/css skills. 
It was a way for me to design, code and deploy a single page application whilst reinforcing the basic skill set of any Full Stack programmer.

The site can be used as an example of semantic html coding as well as pruning unneccesary css. 

As a result of this work I have learnt and refined the basics for website design using html and css.

## <h2 style="text-align:center" id="features">Features</h2>
This site has been created keeping accessability standards in mind.
It includes semantic html elements. These have been constructed in a logical structure. 
I have included five images all include alt text as part of the accessability standards I have met.
The title was updated to correctly reflect the organisations name.
